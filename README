deadPengu1n is (imo) a bug in the Pangu untether binary

The Pangu 7.1.1 Jailbreak uses a kernelvuln, which does not require root and is accessible from mobile.
The problem with this is that the untether binary /panguaxe is not protected and does not do any checking.
Once called it fires up the kernelexploit which (in my tests) has a 100% chance of panicing the device if the kernel
is patched already.
Every Appsotre app runs as mobile and can access the binary with the use of private headers, which means every
Appstore app is able to kernelpanic your device, by simply running the untether binary.
Isn't this an epic anti-jailbreak protection huh? XDDDD
Just kidding
Hopefully this will be patched soon, to at least check if the user who executes is root or mobile.
Even better would be to check if kernelpatches are applied already.
Until then, everyone with a Pangu Jailbreak can have fun with kernelpanics and everyone else can have fun with
a cute penguin.

The compiled app binary can be found in my repo: http://repo.tihmstar.net
